Djikstra!
========

Playing with path algorithms in LOVE2D.

### Instructions

If you need instructions to play a videogame, then you came to the right place!
In Djikstra! you face off against an AI opponent in a race to the center of a
diagonally symmetrical maze of squares! The controls are a little like Rogue.
Warning: this game is extremely fair. The AI has no information that you don't
have, and your moves are always evaluated first. What this means is, you should
be winning 100% of games you play, and if you aren't then you are probably broken
and in need of repairs. Never press 'ESCAPE', because that would end the game.

### Distributions

You should just be able to download these and run them. Maybe on Linux you will need to also install love.
