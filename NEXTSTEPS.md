NEXTSTEPS
---------

[x] bootstrap this shit
[x] generate the map randomly
[x] generate the corresponding adjacencies
[x] test that a path exists from corner to corner
[x] mirror the map (there must be overlap between the mirrors...)
[x] use the adjacency matrix to get the shortest path to the middle
[x] implement rogue-like movement with the AI moving randomly
[x] implement collision with walls
[x] add the shortest path algorithm to the AI
[x] encouraging messages
[x] victory to the fellow at the center!
