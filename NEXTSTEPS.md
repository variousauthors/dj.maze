NEXTSTEPS
---------

[x] bootstrap this shit
[x] generate the map randomly
[x] generate the corresponding adjacencies
[ ] test that a path exists from corner to corner
[ ] mirror the map and adjacency matrix (there must be overlap between the mirrors...)
[ ] generate a symmetrical adjacency matrix with a clear middle tile
[ ] generate a symmetrical adjacency matrix with a shortest path
[ ] implement rogue-like movement with the AI moving randomly
[ ] add the shortest path algorithm to the AI
[ ] victory to the fellow at the center!
[ ] add the colours and striped score bar
[ ] add music, a countdown, and a taunt or two for losing
[ ] the dudes should pulse to the music when they move, and take turns moving
[ ] the dudes should leave a coloured trail behind them
